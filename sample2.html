<h1>My two different High School experiences</h1>
<p><b>My </b> high school life started on a bumpy road. The pandemic started when I was in my first year of high school.<p>
<p><u><i>It</i></u> was very hard to start high school on online classes, since I was just transitioning from an elementary student to a high school student, a STE student to be specific.<p>
<p> I felt under pressure because of the program and the high school work intimidated me so much. However I was able to survive by strengthening my mind and improving my studying habits. And now that we are having face-to-face classes, high school life is more enjoyable now.</p>
