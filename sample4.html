<h1 style="color:brown"><b>Sipo Eggs Recipe</b></h1>
<h2><i><span style="color:brown">Sipo Eggs</span> is a Filipino quail egg and shrimp dish that originated in Pampanga. 
This dish includes a rich, thick sauce, shrimp, quail eggs and mixed vegetables containing carrots, green peas, and corn. 
It is only served on exceptional occasions.</i></h2>
<h3>Comparison of <span style="color:brown">Sipo eggs</span> and Chicken Pastel</h3>
<p>As a child, I would often mistake Chicken Pastel as my favorite dish, <span stle="color:brown" "font-weight:bold">Sipo Eggs</span>. I cannot distinguish the difference
between the two dishes back then because it looks the same for me. It features a creamy sauce, chicken and carrots. 
However, now that I'm already a teenager, I've come to know that their difference is that,
Sipo egg has of course eggs, shrimp, carrot and peas. While Chicken Pastel have, sausages, mushrooms, green and red bell pepper.</p>
<h3 style="color:red">Sipo egg Versions</h3>
<p>For a more festive and rich taste of <span style="color:brown">Sipo egg</span> you can add minced ham or luncheon meat. 
Another version would be using this dish as a topping for pasta but excluding the egg, 
and you'll get something similar to Shrimp Alfredo</p>
