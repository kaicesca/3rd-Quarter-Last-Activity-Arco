<h1 align="center">TREE</h1>
<h3 align="center">by Joyce Kilmer</h3>
<p align="center">I think that I shall never see</p>
<br>
<p align="center">A poem lovely as a tree.</p>
<br>
<p align="center">A tree whose hungry mouth is prest</p>
<br>
<p align="center">Against the earthâ€™s sweet flowing breast;</p>
<br>
<p align="center">A tree that looks at God all day,</p>
<br>
<p align="center">And lifts her leafy arms to pray;</p>
<br>
<p align="center">A tree that may in Summer wear</p>
<br>
<p align="center">A nest of robins in her hair;</p>
<br>
<p align="center">Upon whose bosom snow has lain;</p>
<br>
<p align="center">Who intimately lives with rain.</p>
<br>
<p align="center">Poems are made by fools like me,</p>
<br>
<p align="center">But only God can make a tree.</p>
